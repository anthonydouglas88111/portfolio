## üåü Customizable theme

There are some premade themes that I have made for this portfolio inside `theme-examples.css` file. Just copy paste the styles to `globals.css` after that you are good to go or Create your own theme by editing the css variables in `globals.css`

### Note

1. When creating custom theme the css variables only take hsl value seperated by space
2. Theme color for Animated Logo have to be hard coded.

### ‚ú® Seo

1. The project automatically generates sitemap.xml and robots.txt files within the public folder by leveraging the project's file structure. This process is initiated through the scripts located at src/scripts/generateSitemap.mjs, executed either after the project is built or by running the command `pnpm sitemap`.
2. It's important to note that [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), identified by file or folder names in square brackets (e.g., [segmentName], [id], or [slug]), are excluded from the sitemap.xml.
3. Update google site verification code with your own inside `/src/data/metadata.mjs`. Can be created for free using your google email id at <https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome>
